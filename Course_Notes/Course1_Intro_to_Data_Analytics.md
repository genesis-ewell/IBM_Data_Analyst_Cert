### Modern Data Ecosystem
- Network of interconnected, independent, and continually evolving entities.
- Includes data from different sources, different types of analysis, and skills to generate insights.  
- **Data sources:** structured & unstructured (text, images, videos, social media, conversations).  
- **Step 1:** Pull data from sources.  
- **Step 2:** Organize, clean, optimize, and ensure compliance requirements are met.  
- **Master data tables** are created for consistency.  
- **Business stakeholders:** anyone pulling data from repositories.

### Key Players in the Ecosystem
- **Data Engineers:**  
  - Develop & maintain data architectures.  
  - Extract, integrate, clean, transform, and prepare data.  
  - Design, store, and manage repositories.  
  - Skills: programming languages, architectures, relational & non-relational data stores.  

- **Data Analysts:**  
  - Translate numbers into plain language for decision-making.  
  - Inspect, clean, and analyze data for insights.  
  - Identify correlations, patterns, and apply statistical methods.  
  - Skills: spreadsheets, SQL, statistical methods, dashboards, some programming, storytelling.  

- **Data Scientists:**  
  - Build machine learning models using historical data for predictive insights.  
  - Skills: math, statistics, programming, databases, model building.  

- **Business Analysts:**  
  - Use outputs from analysts & scientists to recommend business actions.  

- **Business Intelligence Analysts:**  
  - Similar role but focus on **external influences** affecting business.

### Defining Data Analysis
- **Process of:** gathering, cleaning, analyzing, mining, interpreting, and reporting data.  
- Purpose: understand past data → make better future decisions.

#### Four Types of Data Analysis
1. **Descriptive:** What happened? (Summarizes past data).  
2. **Diagnostic:** Why did it happen? (Dig deeper into descriptive).  
3. **Predictive:** What will happen? (Forecasts outcomes using historical data).  
4. **Prescriptive:** What should be done? (Suggests actions based on predicted outcomes).  

#### Data Analysis Process
1. Set a clear metric (what to measure & how).  
2. Gather data (identify needed data, sources, tools).  
3. Clean data (fix quality issues, standardize missing/incomplete values).  
4. Analyze & mine data (extract, manipulate, find patterns & variations).  
5. Interpret results (check dependability & limitations).  
6. Present findings.

## Responsibilities & Skills of a Data Analyst

### Responsibilities
- Acquire data from primary/secondary sources.  
- Create queries to extract data from databases.  
- Filter, clean, standardize, and reorganize data.  
- Use statistical tools to interpret data sets.  
- Identify patterns & correlations.  
- Prepare reports and charts to communicate findings.  
- Create documentation of analysis process.  

### Skills
- **Tools:** Excel, IBM Cognos, SPSS, Oracle, Power BI, SAS, Tableau.  
- **Programming:** R, Python, C++, Java, MATLAB.  
- **Databases:** SQL, relational & NoSQL.  
- **Big Data Tools:** Hadoop, Hive, Spark.  
- Ability to access repositories: data marts, warehouses, lakes, pipelines.
